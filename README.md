# Case Study: Cyclistic Bike Share - Data Cleaning with SQL
### Project Overview

This project analyzes historical trip data from Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago. The goal is to understand the behavioral differences between casual riders and annual members and provide data-driven recommendations to help the marketing team convert casual riders into annual members.

The analysis follows the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act, commonly used in professional analytics workflows.

### Business Task

The marketing director, Lily Moreno, believes that the company’s future growth depends on increasing the number of annual memberships.
The main business question:
How do casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently?

By answering this question, we can develop marketing strategies that encourage casual riders to become members.

### Key Stakeholders

Cyclistic Executive Team – Decision makers who will approve marketing strategies

Lily Moreno (Director of Marketing) – Responsible for campaign development

Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team – Responsible for collecting and analyzing data

### Tools Used

- SQL –> Data cleaning and transformation

- Excel –> Initial exploration

- R –> Data analysis

- Tableau  –> Data visualization

- GitHub –> Project documentation and version control


### Data Cleaning & Processing

Steps taken to prepare the dataset:

1. Combined all the monthly tables in one table. 

2. Data inspection
   
Check:

- Column names

- Data types
  
- Remove trips with missing (null) values
  
  SELECT *
  
  FROM [2025-tripdata].[dbo].[year_ride_2025_combinedTable]
  
	WHERE start_station_id IS NOT NULL

  AND end_station_id IS NOT NULL;
  

- Remove duplicate ride IDs

3. Create Ride Length Column
   Goal: Calculate ride duration
- Ride length (ride_length: ride_length = ended_at - started_at)



8. Created additional fields:

- Ride length (ride_length: ride_length = ended_at - started_at)

- Day of week (day_of_week: day_of_week = weekday(started_at)

- Month ????

5. Filtered out rides with negative or unrealistic durations

6. Standardized column formats across all monthly datasets


3. Process (Data Cleaning)
